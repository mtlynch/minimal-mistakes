## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to those who helped along the way:

	* His project, [PiPlanter 2](http://www.esologic.com/?page_id=1042) heavily inspired the hardware aspects of GreenPiThumb
* [Dickson Chow](http://dicksonchow.com)
	* His project, [Plant Friends](http://dicksonchow.com/plant-friends-mkii/) was a helpful hardware reference as well and he supplied a cool [lead-free soil moisture sensor](http://dickson.bigcartel.com/product/soil-probe-for-plant-friends) that we used in GreenPiThumb.
