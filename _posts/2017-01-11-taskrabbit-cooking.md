# Overview

For the past few years, I've been trying to outsource tasks in my daily life whenever possible. I tend to be more limited by available time than money, so if I think I can save an hour by spending $30, I'll generally do it.

I recently started experimenting with [the keto diet](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto) (basically: very low carbs), which I've been enjoying. The problem is that it really limits what food delivery I can order, as BBQ, deli sandwiches, BBQ, pizza, etc. do not fit with the keto diet.

I've found some sites that offer free keto recipes (my favorite being [ruled.me](http://ruled.me)), but I don't really like cooking. I thought this would be a good opportunity to experiment with outsourcing: I can pick the recipes and hire someone else to handle the rest.

# Finding a TaskRabbit to Do It All

The first two recipes I picked were [Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Pork Tenderloin](http://www.ruled.me/bacon-wrapped-stuffed-pork-tenderloin/) and [Neapolitan Fat Bombs](http://www.ruled.me/neapolitan-fat-bombs/).

Since I was approaching this as a way to save time, I figured the way to save the *most* time would be if the TaskRabbit not only did the cooking, but the shopping as well (TaskRabbit allows workers to invoice for their expenses).

Most of the ingredients that the recipes called for were things that I didn't have in my kitchen, so it seemed like it would be simple to just say, "buy all this except for salt, olive oil, and pepper."

# Not So Much...

The first person I reached out to had 100% positive reviews and had already completed two cooking tasks. She charged $29/hr for cooking, so I offered her the job and she promptly declined. I've never had a TaskRabbit decline a job before, so I figured it was just a fluke.

I found another that had 86% positive reviews and charged $22/hr. She messaged me to say she'd do the cooking but wasn't willing to do any shopping. Determined to find someone to handle everything, I thanked her and continued looking. The third TaskRabbit I offered the job to also declined immediately.

# Simplifying the Job

At this point, I decided to simplify things. I eliminated the ingredient shopping aspect and reduced the job to strictly cooking. However, TaskRabbit doesn't allow you to re-offer the job to people who have already declined so I had inadvertently eliminated my top three picks.

The best remaining option was a woman named Leah with a 73% positive rating (pretty bad by TaskRabbit standards) and only one cooking review, which was negative (no explanation given). But she charged $26/hr, which is relatively inexpensive, and I was willing to take a gamble that I'm probably a much easier food critic than most people that would hire and review a TaskRabbit chef. Leah accepted the job and within a few minutes, we had scheduled an appointment for two days later.

## The First Meal

Leah showed up right on time the evening she was scheduled. I showed her my kitchen and handed her the printed recipes and she was off to work.

The process went very smoothly. She did her thing for a little over two hours. I took advantage of the extra free time she was giving me and worked on [ProsperBot]({{ base_path }}/prosperbot/). It's always kind of awkward having a stranger in my house with me, but my kitchen is isolated enough from the rest of my apartment that we both had a decent amount of privacy. At times, I briefly forgot she was there.

When she was done, she told me I could take the pork tenderloin out of the oven in ten minutes, the pepper and broccoli were finished on the stove, and that the neapolitan fat bombs were in the freezer. She had wiped down my countertops and cleaned my dishes. When the tenderloin was ready, I took it out and was delighted. It looked great and tasted fantastic.

The experience went pretty much exactly as I had wanted it to. I've hired Leah to cook three more times since then and I've been very pleased with the results every time.

# How much does it cost?

When I tell people I'm doing this, the first thing they want to know is: how much does it cost? Until I sat down to write this post, I wasn't really sure. The cost for hiring a TaskRabbit is easy because I get a bill at the end of each session. It's much harder to calculate the cost of ingredients: I don't buy all the ingredients for a meal at the same time, and I can't buy the exact amount of an ingredient that the recipe calls for.

## Costing Methodology

The most straightforward way I could think of for accounting for costs was to amortize by the amount that the recipe calls for. For example, if a recipe calls for 3 oz. of cream cheese and I buy an 8 oz. package for $3.49, I consider the amortized cost of that ingredient to be $1.31 (&#8540; * $3.49).

This is a very conservative estimate because a lot of recipes call for ingredients that spoil, so I end up having to throw some ingredients away if I can't use them in other meals. There are also ingredients that don't spoil quickly, but will be difficult to get through, like powdered Ranch dressing. The smallest amount I could buy cost $14.03 for a 16 oz. container, when the recipe only called for 2 tsp ($0.29 worth). It has a shelf life of about 5 months, but it's going to be tough finding more recipes that call for powdered Ranch dressing. Overall, I probably lose about $3-6 per cooking session to suboptimal ingredient purchasing.

## Raw Numbers

## Price Analysis

I didn't realize until I calculated everything out that I spent almost exactly the same amount (to within $2) each time (except for Session 3, when I asked Leah to prepare an extra dessert). Looking at the totals, I feel like it's a pretty good deal. If we look at Session 4, for example, I'm paying the equivalent of $20 for each entree and $2.50 for each cheesecake cupcake (which were amazing). Although that cost assumes optimal use of ingredients, so we'd maybe add $1-2 to the cost of each meal to get closer to reality.

I still cook some of my meals like scrambled eggs or steak, but I've stopped ordering from [Seamless](https://seamless.extole.com/s/nvhmp). If we think of TaskRabbit cooking as a replacement for Seamless, I'm about even with my previous spending, because I tend to spend about $10-20 on lunches through Seamless and my dinners tend to be $15-30 (including tax, tip, and fees).

# Conclusion

This experience made me realize that I find cooking very exciting when I don't have to do it. I have a lot of friends who can get excited about reading recipes and I've never been able to relate to that; I just think about how all the work of cooking it isn't really worth the effort for me. But now that I've separated the work of cooking from picking a recipe, I find it really fun. I'll scroll through recipes and think, "Wow, I can't wait to schedule Leah so I can eat that!"

I suspect that I could refine this process further. I end up spending a lot of time searching for good recipes and managing the ingredients, so I'm considering other solutions. A friend suggested I'm probably paying a rate close to what hourly chefs charge, so I'm thinking about whether it's feasible to use a private chef for this (outside of TaskRabbit) who either brings their own ingredients to me or cooks at their own place and delivers to me.

# Tips for Hiring TaskRabbit Chefs

## Buy your own ingredients

In my experience, asking the TaskRabbit to both cook and shop limits those who will be interested in the job and introduces a lot more complexity into the task (you have to communicate what to buy, how much is okay to spend, then reimburse, then reconcile their shopping rate with their cooking rate).

## Don't add a tip

This one's not so much a recommendation, just what I choose to do.

TaskRabbit allows you to add tip, but from what I've read online, adding a tip is not the norm. I think [tipping culture is net negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_vivC7c_1k), so I don't tip for things unless it's a strongly implied part of the cost (e.g. restaurants, taxis). Each TaskRabbit worker chooses their own rate for the services they offer, so it doesn't really make sense to add a tip on top of that.

## Have everything ready

I make sure to have everything prepared to go by the time my TaskRabbit arrives. Recipes are printed, counters are clear, ingredients are ready.

One thing I find easy to forget is clearing space in my fridge or freezer for recipes that need to be chilled or frozen. Leah has kindly rearranged my fridge space for me when I've forgotten, but I'd rather let her focus on the cooking.

## On the first visit, give a tour of your kitchen

After the first session, I found that some of the kitchen tools I expected Leah to need (e.g. measuring spoons, spatula) had gone unused. I realized that she probably didn't notice I had them and decided to make do without.

After that, I reorganized my kitchen so that all of my cooking tools were in more obvious places. The next time Leah came to cook, I made sure to briefly walk her through what I had available and where it was.

## Check in after to solicit feedback

As a corrolary to the above, I realized that Leah was probably uncomfortable telling me that I was missing kitchen equipment that she needed, so if I wanted to find out, I'd need to ask her. Aside from that, she's in my home working for me, so I want to make sure I'm treating her with respect, so it's useful for me to find out about things like missing equipment or deficiencies in the process.

After the first session, I reached out to Leah to ask if there were any changes I could make to the process or my kitchen setup to make the experience better for her. I had asked her to use my [Magic Bullet](http://a.co/fbcdbB5) to blend ingredients, but Leah told me that it works great for liquids, but not so well for mixing dry ingredients. She recommended an immersion blender, so I ordered [a simple one](http://a.co/adS0PQm) from Amazon for $50. Easy peasy.

I've made this a regular practice, and I've gotten some good feedback from Leah from it. Many of her recommendations have come in handy even when she's not here and I'm cooking for myself.
